# Grid2DIsometric
Code monkeys grid implementation with isometric coordinates

quick note: this only works for 2:1 ratio grids, havent found the math for other ratio's. And im not a mathmetician so couldn't figure it out on my own :p

resource that i used for the math: https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/creating-isometric-worlds-a-primer-for-game-developers--gamedev-6511
